</summary>

Advanced users can auto install WireGuard using custom options, by specifying command-line options when running the script. For more details, see the next section "view usage information for the WireGuard script".

Alternatively, you may provide a Bash "here document" as input to the setup script. This method can also be used to provide input to manage users after install.

First, install WireGuard interactively using custom options, and write down all your inputs to the script.

```bash
sudo bash wireguard.sh
```

If you need to remove WireGuard, run the script again and select the appropriate option.

Next, create the custom install command using your inputs. Example:

```bash
sudo bash wireguard.sh <<ANSWERS
n
51820
client
2
y
ANSWERS
```

**Note:** The install options may change in future versions of the script.
